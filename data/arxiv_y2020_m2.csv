Classification accuracy as a proxy for two sample testing,"['Ilmun Kim', 'Aaditya Ramdas', 'Aarti Singh', 'Larry Wasserman']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02210,"When data analysts train a classifier and check if its accuracy is significantly different from chance, they are implicitly performing a two-sample test. We investigate the statistical properties of this flexible approach in the high-dimensional setting. We prove two results that hold for all classifiers in any dimensions: if its true error remains εε-better than chance for some ε>0ε>0 as…",2020-02-17,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML']"

3D Time-lapse Reconstruction from Internet Photos,"['Ricardo Martin-Brualla', 'David Gallup', 'Steven M. Seitz']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03019,"Given an Internet photo collection of a landmark, we compute a 3D time-lapse video sequence where a virtual camera moves continuously in time and space. While previous work assumed a static camera, the addition of camera motion during the time-lapse creates a very compelling impression of parallax. Achieving this goal, however, requires addressing multiple technical challenges, including solving f…",2020-02-21,['cs.CV']
Covariance-Controlled Adaptive Langevin Thermostat for Large-Scale Bayesian Sampling,"['Xiaocheng Shang', 'Zhanxing Zhu', 'Benedict Leimkuhler', 'Amos J.
