Vazirani', 'Sadra Yazdanbod']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5060,"This paper resolves two of the handful of remaining questions on the computability of market equilibria, a central theme within algorithmic game theory (AGT). Our results are as follows:
  1. We show FIXP-hardness of computing equilibria in Arrow-Debreu markets under Leontief utility functions, and Arrow-Debreu markets under linear utility functions and Leontief production sets. We note that these…",2020-05-20,"['cs.CC', 'cs.GT']"
Computing rank of finite algebraic structures with limited nondeterminism,['Jeffrey Finkelstein'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0879,"The rank of a finite algebraic structure with a single binary operation is the minimum number of elements needed to express every other element under the closure of the operation. In the case of groups, the previous best algorithm for computing rank used polylogarithmic space. We reduce the best upper bounds on the complexity of computing rank for groups and for quasigroups. This paper proves that…",2020-05-19,['cs.CC']
A Supervised Goal Directed Algorithm in Economical Choice Behaviour: An Actor-Critic Approach,['Keyvan Yahya'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3579,This paper aims to find an algorithmic structure that affords to predict and explain economical choice behaviour particularly under uncertainty(random policies) by manipulating the prevalent Actor-Critic learning method to comply with the requirements we have been entrusted ever since the field of neuroeconomics dawned on us. Whilst skimming some basics of neuroeconomics that seem relevant to our…,2020-05-03,"['cs.GT', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']"
Boson-Sampling in the light of sample complexity,"['C. Gogolin', 'M. Kliesch', 'L. Aolita', 'J. Eisert']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3995,"Boson-Sampling is a classically computationally hard problem that can - in principle - be efficiently solved with quantum linear optical networks. Very recently, a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators. Even approximate Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if the unitary describing the op…",2020-05-14,"['quant-ph', 'cs.CC']"
Alternating Maximization: Unifying Framework for 8 Sparse PCA Formulations and Efficient Parallel Codes,"['Peter Richtárik', 'Majid Jahani', 'Selin Damla Ahipaşaoğlu', 'Martin Takáč']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4137,"Given a multivariate data set, sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) aims to extract several linear combinations of the variables that together explain the variance in the data as much as possible, while controlling the number of nonzero loadings in these combinations. In this paper we consider 8 different optimization formulations for computing a single sparse loading vector; these are obtai…",2020-05-06,"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC']"
Incremental Medians via Online Bidding,"['Marek Chrobak', 'Claire Kenyon', 'John Noga', 'Neal E. Young']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0504103,"In the k-median problem we are given sets of facilities and customers, and distances between them. For a given set F of facilities, the cost of serving a customer u is the minimum distance between u and a facility in F. The goal is to find a set F of k facilities that minimizes the sum, over all customers, of their service costs.
  Following Mettu and Plaxton, we study the incremental medians prob…",2020-05-28,['cs.DS']
