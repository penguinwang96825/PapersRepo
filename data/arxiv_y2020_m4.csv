Modelling serendipity in a computational context,"['Joseph Corneli', 'Anna Jordanous', 'Christian Guckelsberger', 'Alison Pease', 'Simon Colton']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0440,"The term serendipity describes a creative process that develops, in context, with the active participation of a creative agent, but not entirely within that agent's control. While a system cannot be made to perform serendipitously on demand, we argue that its \mathit{serendipity\ potential}\mathit{serendipity\ potential} can be increased by means of a suitable system architecture and other design choices. We distil a unified…",2020-04-19,['cs.AI']
On the Tractability of Un/Satisfiability,['Latif Salum'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5282,"This paper shows effectiveness of X3SAT in proving P = NP. This is due to the fact that it is easy to check unsatisfiability of a particular truth assignment. A truth assignment leads to some reductions of clauses by means of ""exactly-1 disjunction"". The reductions result in a conjunction of literals, called the scope of the assignment. It is proved that this particular truth assignment makes the…",2020-04-07,['cs.CC']
SIMD Compression and the Intersection of Sorted Integers,"['Daniel Lemire', 'Leonid Boytsov', 'Nathan Kurz']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6399,"Sorted lists of integers are commonly used in inverted indexes and database systems. They are often compressed in memory. We can use the SIMD instructions available in common processors to boost the speed of integer compression schemes. Our S4-BP128-D4 scheme uses as little as 0.7 CPU cycles per decoded integer while still providing state-of-the-art compression.
  However, if the subsequent proces…",2020-04-20,"['cs.IR', 'cs.DB', 'cs.PF']"
Computing the multilinear factors of lacunary polynomials without heights,"['Arkadev Chattopadhyay', 'Bruno Grenet', 'Pascal Koiran', 'Natacha Portier', 'Yann Strozecki']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.5694,"We present a deterministic algorithm which computes the multilinear factors of multivariate lacunary polynomials over number fields. Its complexity is polynomial in \ell^n\ell^n where \ell\ell is the lacunary size of the input polynomial and nn its number of variables, that is in particular polynomial in the logarithm of its degree. We also provide a randomized algorithm for the same problem of complex…",2020-04-21,"['cs.SC', 'cs.CC']"
Segmentation of Encrypted data,"['Eric Järpe', 'Quentin Gouchet']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4275,"The retrieval of data from computer hard drives that have been seized from police busts against suspected criminals are sometimes not straight forward. Typically the incriminating data, which may be important evidence in subsequent trials, is encrypted and quick deleted. The cryptanalysis of what can be recovered from such hard drives is then subject to time-consuming brute-forcing and password gu…",2020-04-27,"['cs.CR', 'stat.ME']"
Polynomiality for Bin Packing with a Constant Number of Item Types,"['Michel X. Goemans', 'Thomas Rothvoss']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5108,"We consider the bin packing problem with d different item sizes s_i and item multiplicities a_i, where all numbers are given in binary encoding. This problem formulation is also known as the 1-dimensional cutting stock problem.
  In this work, we provide an algorithm which, for constant d, solves bin packing in polynomial time. This was an open problem for all d >= 3.
  In fact, for constant d our…",2020-04-29,"['cs.DS', 'cs.CG', 'math.CO']"
"Group ring cryptography: Cryptography, key exchange, public key",['Ted Hurley'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4063,General cryptographic schemes are presented where keys can be one-time or ephemeral. Processes for key exchange are derived. Public key cryptographic schemes based on the new systems are easily established. Authentication and signature schemes are implemented. The schemes are an advance on group ring techniques and are easily implemented but highly secure. They may be integrated with error-correct…,2020-04-10,"['cs.CR', 'math.RA']"
Hierarchical Bin Buffering: Online Local Moments for Dynamic External Memory Arrays,"['Daniel Lemire', 'Owen Kaser']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610128,"Local moments are used for local regression, to compute statistical measures such as sums, averages, and standard deviations, and to approximate probability distributions. We consider the case where the data source is a very large I/O array of size n and we want to compute the first N local moments, for some constant N. Without precomputation, this requires O(n) time. We develop a sequence of algo…",2020-04-26,"['cs.DS', 'cs.DB']"
