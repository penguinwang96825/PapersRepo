Adversarial hypothesis testing and a quantum Stein's Lemma for restricted measurements,"['Fernando G. S. L. Brandao', 'Aram W. Harrow', 'James R. Lee', 'Yuval Peres']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6702,Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two convex sets of probability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a distribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from which set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential rate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood ratio test which does…,2020-03-09,"['cs.IT', 'math.PR', 'quant-ph']"
On the Heisenberg principle at macroscopic scales: understanding classical negative information. Towards a general physical theory of information,['Alvaro Lopez-Medrano'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.5219,"With the aid of a toy model, the Monty Hall Problem (MHP), the counterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information in classical systems is well understood. It is shown that, as its quantum counterpart, classical local mutual information, obtained through a measurement, can be expressed as the difference between the information gained with the evidence and the negative in…",2020-03-02,"['cs.IT', 'q-bio.NC']"
On the probability of being synchronizable,['Mikhail V. Berlinkov'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5774,"We prove that a random automaton with nn states and any fixed non-singleton alphabet is synchronizing with high probability. Moreover, we also prove that the convergence rate is exactly 1-Θ(\frac{1}{n})1-Θ(\frac{1}{n}) as conjectured by Cameron \cite{CamConj} for the most interesting binary alphabet case. Finally, we describe a deterministic algorithm which decides whether a given random automaton is synchroni…",2020-03-28,"['cs.FL', 'cs.DM', 'math.CO']"
StructBoost: Boosting Methods for Predicting Structured Output Variables,"['Chunhua Shen', 'Guosheng Lin', 'Anton van den Hengel']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.3283,"Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured learning has found many applications in computer vision. Inspired by structured support vector machines (SSVM), here we propose a new boosting algorithm for structured output prediction, which we refer to as StructBoost. StructBoost supports nonlinear struc…",2020-03-08,['cs.LG']
Practical design of multi-channel oversampled warped cosine-modulated filter banks,"['Maxim Vashkevich', 'Wanggen Wan', 'Alexander Petrovsky']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0737,A practical approach to optimal design of multichannel oversampled warped cosine-modulated filter banks (CMFB) is proposed. Warped CMFB is obtained by allpass transformation of uniform CMFB. The paper addresses the problems of minimization amplitude distortion and suppression of aliasing components emerged due to oversampling of filter bank channel signals. Proposed optimization-based design consi…,2020-03-25,['cs.IT']
Linear Latent Force Models using Gaussian Processes,"['Mauricio A. Álvarez', 'David Luengo', 'Neil D. Lawrence']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.2699,"Purely data driven approaches for machine learning present difficulties when data is scarce relative to the complexity of the model or when the model is forced to extrapolate. On the other hand, purely mechanistic approaches need to identify and specify all the interactions in the problem at hand (which may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of how to parameterize the system. In this paper…",2020-03-13,"['stat.ML', 'cs.AI']"
The mathematics of Septoku,['George I. Bell'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3697,"Septoku is a Sudoku variant invented by Bruce Oberg, played on a hexagonal grid of 37 cells. We show that up to rotations, reflections, and symbol permutations, there are only six valid Septoku boards. In order to have a unique solution, we show that the minimum number of given values is six. We generalize the puzzle to other board shapes, and devise a puzzle on a star-shaped board with 73 cells w…",2020-03-12,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM', 'math.GM']"
