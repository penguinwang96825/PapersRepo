Specifically, we develop an iterative distillation method that transfers the structured information of l…",2020-08-08,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'stat.ML']"
Matching while Learning,"['Ramesh Johari', 'Vijay Kamble', 'Yash Kanoria']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04549,"We consider the problem faced by a service platform that needs to match limited supply with demand but also to learn the attributes of new users in order to match them better in the future. We introduce a benchmark model with heterogeneous ""workers"" (demand) and a limited supply of ""jobs"" that arrive over time. Job types are known to the platform, but worker types are unknown and must be learned b…",2020-08-05,"['cs.LG', 'cs.DS', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML']"
Probably Approximately Correct Greedy Maximization with Efficient Bounds on Information Gain for Sensor Selection,"['Yash Satsangi', 'Shimon Whiteson', 'Frans A.

However, most existing methods, based on greedy maximization, assume it is computationally feasible to evaluate F, the function being maximized. Unfortunately, in many realistic settings F is too expensive to evaluate exactly even once. We present probably approximately correct greedy maximizati…",2020-08-10,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']"
Dual-Context Calculi for Modal Logic,['G. A. Kavvos'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04860,"We present natural deduction systems and associated modal lambda calculi for the necessity fragments of the normal modal logics K, T, K4, GL and S4. These systems are in the dual-context style: they feature two distinct zones of assumptions, one of which can be thought as modal, and the other as intuitionistic. We show that these calculi have their roots in in sequent calculi. We then investigate…",2020-08-18,['cs.LO']
A Coinductive Approach to Proof Search through Typed Lambda-Calculi,"['José Espírito Santo', 'Ralph Matthes', 'Luís Pinto']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04382,"In reductive proof search, proofs are naturally generalized by solutions, comprising all (possibly infinite) structures generated by locally correct, bottom-up application of inference rules.

Flexible constraint satisfiability and a problem in semigroup theory,['Marcel Jackson'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03127,"We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability.

Elicitation Complexity of Statistical Properties,"['Rafael Frongillo', 'Ian A.
